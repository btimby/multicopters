Introduction
============

This is my repository of flying things. There are 3D printed parts, flight
controller software, configuration files etc.

You will find stuff related to MultiWii, APM, CC3D, MakerGear M2, Slic3r,
Pronterface etc.

You might find something useful here, but you might not. This repository is a
tool I use to improve the designs of my multirotor models. Thus it is a
benefit mostly for myself.
