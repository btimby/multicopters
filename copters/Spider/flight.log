11-25-2014: Flew today in very strong winds. It handled very nicely. I noticed that two of the props seem to "click" as if they are hitting one another from time to time. I think the frame has a bit too much flex in it. The battery monitor worked perfectly. I crashed and broke the front right arm.

I just reprinted the right side with 80% infill instead of 30% infill. It is MUCH stiffer and stronger. I won't replace the other parts until the (inevitably) break.
